Board description

This project targets STM32F7xx MCU series and
the target board is Discovery for 767zi.

Pin layout:

    PC6 .. PC13 - sampled GPIO pins
    (PC13 is wired to a push button on my discovery)

    PD5         - USART2_TX for packet transmission

Used peripherals:

    * General-purpose timer for 1kHz interrupt rate
    * GPIO
    * USART2
    * CRC accelerator

The pin state is sampled every 1ms and is stored in a ping-pong buffer in the
interrupt routine. The non-interrupt code waits for the buffer swap and
flushes the back buffer to make it available for upcoming samples.
